- Public Interface with Case Tracking: A user-friendly interface for the public to track case progress, receive updates, and understand legal proceedings.
- Automated Document Drafting: Auto-generate legal documents (e.g., notices, standard filings) in regional formats based on case specifics. The tool identifies possible inconsistencies with existing precedents.
- Abuse Detection: Flag potential abuse of provisions (e.g., repeat filings, bail abuse) using AI-based pattern recognition.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and professionalism, evoking the gravity of the legal system.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), a desaturated version of the primary, to provide a neutral and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#4CAF50), an analogous color to the primary, suggesting growth and fairness; it will be less saturated and brighter, and be used sparingly for CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for body text to provide readability and a literary feel, paired with 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, offering a modern contrast.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that represent legal concepts and actions (e.g., document, search, court) with a touch of elegance.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with clear separation between sections and user roles (public vs. professional interfaces).
- Employ subtle animations for loading, transitions, and feedback to improve user experience without being distracting.
